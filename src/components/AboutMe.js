            <p className="summary">I'm Josh, but most of my friends call me Hutch. After graduating from The University of Georgia with an Agricultural Business degree, I was left without much of an idea of what to do next. I have always had an interest in the technology we all use everyday, so I enrolled with Thinkful and began learning to become a web developer. Now I am searching for my next big opportunity to work with a team of developers in order to improve my skills and make a name for myself in this ever growing industry.</p>
